# requirements installed.  Skip down to the bottom, where you can see examples of
# what to do.
#
# These additional installs will be applied BOTH when you execute your container
# for the first time, as well as when you build a new derivative container 
# using ../build.sh.

# No need to change the following.... head down below...
